My goal for this project was to create a drama tracker that helps me to record what I watch. I’m an avid Chinese drama watcher, so for the past year I’ve been trying to figure out how to organize my data. This project was the perfect opportunity for me to do that. On the main page, I have all of my old dramas (2018-2021), which are from an old JSON file that I created last year. I uploaded it to my database as "oldreviews", and access it in my code in order to display them. When you click 'my reviews', you’re prompted to sign in, and then you can add a review from there. I will expand this project by including a drama based API. There are very few that have enough data for a project like the one I would like to do, but there are scrapers available that I will use instead.
